right now:
    - install qemu
    - use new golang!!!!
    - structure my code for reuse and proper testing
    - write some test code
    - try showing page using telegra.ph api
    - what would be if I used tags not listed as available in telegra.ph api?


    - []Item vs []*Item. Are they different in space?

    - implement a view of an item when you select one(Just title? Using telegra.ph? Try as many variants as possible using git branches.)
    - entry -> element (use more generic name?)
    - https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#type-sets
    - try using go 1.18 and generics
notes:
    - Try to do feed list more efficiently(preallocate an array of EntriesPerPage elements)
    - provide clear interface through telegram bot(add all commands and imagine what should be displayed) 
    - store data in internal memory for now(map)
    - what about security concerns due to malicious clients?
future:
    - Provide single interface between rss feeds DS and atom feeds DS
    - Add helper commands to make it easier to get rss feeds from youtube or other sites where it's a little bit obscure. (e.g. /add_youtube, /add_facebook)
